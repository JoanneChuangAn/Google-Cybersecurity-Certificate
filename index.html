    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>This website is the final result of my conceptualization of a secure, ethical, and user-centered digital platform. As a web developer, I explore four key areas of platform architecture: Systems Design, Content and Information Architecture, User Experience, and the Ethics and Privacy of Cybersecurity. The purpose of this website is to illustrate how to build a digital platform that works, is efficient, protects users, and builds trust.</p>

    <h2>User Experience & Visual Design</h2>
    <p>User experience is not just about how a product looks, it also ensures that every interaction is intuitive and enjoyable. A well-designed website allows users to navigate easily and feel satisfied. Netflix, for example, is praised for its clear layout and personalization features.</p>

  <section id="architecture">
    <h2>Content & Information Architecture</h2>
    <p>Good architecture helps users find what they need easily. Clear navigation menus, search functionality, and intuitive layout are key. Avoiding clutter and maintaining a clean structure improves usability and accessibility.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="security">
    <h2>Security & Ethics</h2>
    <p>I chose this focus because a secure, ethical platform doesn't just prioritize efficiency—it protects users. In the age of political conflict and rising cyber threats, protecting user data, ensuring transparency, and mitigating risk with ethical frameworks is critical.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection & Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Through this proof of concept project, I gained a deeper understanding of the relationship between UX, information architecture, and digital ethics. Despite facing layout and communication challenges, I’ve learned that design is about creating something functional, inclusive, and meaningful. This website represents both my learning and growth.</p>
